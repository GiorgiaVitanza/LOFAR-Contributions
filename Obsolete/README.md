# Obsolete LOFAR analysis scripts

These scripts are not used any more; their functionality has been taken over other scripts / tools.

* plotElevation.py: given a Measurement Set, plots the elevation of the target source as a function of time
* do_demixing.py: applies the demixing routine from Bas vdTol to the data to get rid of the A-team sources. The instructions are at the top of the file.
